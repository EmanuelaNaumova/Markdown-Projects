# Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to add formatting elements to plain text documents. It's widely used in documentation, websites, and even messaging platforms.

## 1. Basic Syntax

### 1.1 Headings
Use the `#` symbol to create headings. The number of `#` symbols determines the heading level.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### 1.2. Paragraphs
Paragraphs are created by simply writing text, separated by a blank line.

### 1.3. Lists

#### Ordered List:

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```
#### Unordered List:

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

### 1.4. Links
Create links using the following syntax: 

```
[Link Text](URL)
```

Example: 

```
[Visit GitHub](https://github.com)
```

### 1.5. Images

Insert images with this syntax:
```
![Alt text](image_url)
```

### 1.6. Code Blocks

For inline code, wrap text with backticks: 
```
`code`
```

For code blocks, use triple backticks:

```
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

## 2. Advanced Formatting

### 2.1. Tables

```
| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Header | Title       |
| Row    | Data        |
```

### 2.2. Blockquotes

```
> This is a blockquote.
```
